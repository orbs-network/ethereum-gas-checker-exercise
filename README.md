# Orbs Challenge

"Create a frontend webapp that displays the latest Ethereum gas prices."

<br />

## Notes to reviewer

- The endpoint provided by you didn't alwasy work so I used an alternative.
- I decided to use Etherscan, which is rate delimited, for both API calls because it introduced an interesting problem to solve. There would be no delay if I used another service for one of the calls.
- I'm aware the USD prices don't look quite right but I ran out of time
